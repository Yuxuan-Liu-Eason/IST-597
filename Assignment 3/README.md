# IST-597-00100

In this assignment, I will build a customized stochastic optimizer based on the example
code provided by Ankur Mali [https://github.com/AnkurMali/IST597_Spring_2022/blob/main/assignment00100/Spring2022_IST597_week5_collab_custom_optimizer.ipynb]. 
Then I will compare the customized optimizer with the keras inbuild optimizers (Adam,
SGD, and RMSprop) on both datasets.
