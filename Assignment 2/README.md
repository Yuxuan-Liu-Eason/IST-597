## Introduction
This is a assignment from IST 597 Deep Learning. In this assignment, I will design a MLP with 2 layers to perform classification tasks (with MNIST and Fashion MNIST data sets.)
I will also try different regularizations and observe trade-off between bias and variance. The detailed information can be viewed in the report.
