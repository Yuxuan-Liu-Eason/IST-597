# IST-597-10000

In this assignment, I will compare recurrent and transformers based language models on IMDB dataset. The starter code is provided by Ankur Mali: https://github.com/AnkurMali/IST597_Spring_2022/tree/main/assignment10000
Based on the start code, I tried different optimizers and learning rates and recorded the accuracy and time. In the LSTM, I split 20% of the training set as a validation set. The fixed parameters are: batch size = 512, cell size = 64, dense size = 128, epoch = 10. Below is the summary.
